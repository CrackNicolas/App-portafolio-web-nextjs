To solve this, I led the creation of an index on the key columns of the database, allowing the system to find data quickly, reducing the search time from 1 minute to 0.3 milliseconds. This improvement not only optimized the system, but also provided almost instant responses to users, transforming their experience. Indexing became an essential solution to solve the problem of slow student searches in Sysacad."
